#Space Invaders comments

Note that this project is coded in Java. I used the Eclipse IDE both for code editing and compiling but there shouldn't be any issue to compile the project in other machines.

Keep in mind that the project contains external files (audio files, image files, font files, ... ). The code works with any other files that match the format.

Enjoy this sprite based Space Invaders game! (Instructions on how to play are shown in game!)
