#4 in a line comments

This is a recreation of the classic '4 in a line' board game. You will compete against the machine in a 8x8 board. 

This project is coded in C and therefore user-machine interaction is console based.

Internally it uses a minimax decision algorithm (the depth of the generated tree depends on the chosen difficulty).

Enjoy and try to win!
